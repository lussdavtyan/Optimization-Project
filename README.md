#Optimization-Project
The project will start by giving a theoretical background to the problem. It will discuss the motivation of solving this problem and the way it is used in Machine Learning to do predictions. After
having the big picture, it will zoom in to the mathematical formulation of the problem and discuss one of the approaches to solve it. Finally, it will include an implementation of the solution in
Python. We will compare the results of our implementation and that of the scikit-learn library on
the same dataset and make conclusions
